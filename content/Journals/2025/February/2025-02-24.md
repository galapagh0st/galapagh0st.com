### Recon on Hackinghub

- Look into google dorking hackinghub didn't cover this very well. Maybe the other modules cover it but I am going to add it to the Recon dir.
- Certificate transparency - crt.sh
```bash
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?cn\=%.$1\&output=json | jq -r '.[].name_value' | sed 's/\*\.//g' | sort -u
```
This script should be saved as a bash command that would work like crtsh paypal.com and get a list of domains tied to cert. once piped to a .txt we can use the following to grab all the domains

```bash
cat file.txt | rev | cut -d *.* -f 1,2 | rev | sort -u > newfile.txt
```

- Subfinder is a tool you can use to find Subdomains

Spent to much of my learning time getting these notes set up. Will have to re watch the video's tomorrow to go over the information.
