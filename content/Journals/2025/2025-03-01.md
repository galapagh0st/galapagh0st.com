## Fuzzing and Ffuf

### Difference between Fuzzing and Crawling 
the difference between fuzzing and crawling is that crawling will start with a seed and map out a website based on links. Where you think of crawling as slowely following a trail to find everything Fuzzing is more like teleporting to a bunch of random parts that might exist to see if they do exist. It is a way to brute force a bunch of options to see if they do or do not exist.


Here is a link to a helpful wordlist I will want to install in my vm:
https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists

### Fuzzing a Directory
```bash
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ
```

the above command we see that -w is to se the following wordlist we will be using and the -u is for the URL we will be using

we can also see that the word list has :FUZZ appendad to the end this is saying to replace in the URL where we put FUZZ with a value from our list

## Fuzzing for Webpages

once you have some directories you can start fuzing for the webpages attached to them. You can find out what web pages exist by checking for the extension. Like you can see here:

```bash
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/indexFUZZ
```

as you can see we look at the index since most endpoints will at least have an index page.

once we have that we can then scan for possible pages with the following command

```bash
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/FUZZ.php
```
