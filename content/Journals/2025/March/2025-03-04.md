### Javascript Deobfuscation

ctrl+u look at the source code of the website

#### Obfuscating
Is essentially the act of making code unreadable or very difficult to read for humans

- Code Minification 
	- This is when you put all the code in one line
	- https://www.toptal.com/developers/javascript-minifier
	- Often minified code is saved with the extension `.min.js`.
- Code Packing
	- https://beautifytools.com/javascript-obfuscator.php
	- can be recognized with the function `function(p,a,c,k,e,d)`
	- Although the dictionary type function showed above can change in naming it always tries to pack the original code into an order to execute

##### Advanced Obfuscating
- https://obfuscator.io/
- encoding our strings adds an extra layer of obfuscation
- https://jsfuck.com/
- Obfuscation can impact performance
- https://utf-8.jp/public/jjencode.html
- https://utf-8.jp/public/aaencode.html
- obfuscation can be used to bypass webfilters or restrictions

#### Deobfuscation
- Deobfuscating minified JS
	- easiest way is to open inspector -> go to debugger -> click `{ }` in firefox
	- can also use the following tools
		- https://prettier.io/playground/
		- https://beautifier.io/
- Deobfuscating packed code
	- https://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html
	- another way would be to console.log() the return function of the code
	- Really want to checkout the Secure coding 101 course
