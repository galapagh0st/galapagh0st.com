### Javascript Deobfuscation

ctrl+u look at the source code of the website

#### Obfuscating
Is essentially the act of making code unreadable or very difficult to read for humans

- Code Minification 
	- This is when you put all the code in one line
	- https://www.toptal.com/developers/javascript-minifier
	- Often minified code is saved with the extension `.min.js`.
- Code Packing
	- https://beautifytools.com/javascript-obfuscator.php
	- can be recognized with the function `function(p,a,c,k,e,d)`
	- Although the dictionary type function showed above can change in naming it always tries to pack the original code into an order to execute

##### Advanced Obfuscating
- https://obfuscator.io/
- encoding our strings adds an extra layer of obfuscation
- https://jsfuck.com/
- Obfuscation can impact performance
- https://utf-8.jp/public/jjencode.html
- https://utf-8.jp/public/aaencode.html
- obfuscation can be used to bypass webfilters or restrictions

#### Deobfuscation
- Deobfuscating minified JS
	- easiest way is to open inspector -> go to debugger -> click `{ }` in firefox
	- can also use the following tools
		- https://prettier.io/playground/
		- https://beautifier.io/
- Deobfuscating packed code
	- https://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html
	- another way would be to console.log() the return function of the code
	- Really want to checkout the Secure coding 101 course

#### Encoding

##### Base64
- Spotting
	- Uses = for padding
	- is alpha numeric
- encoding in terminal
	- `echo https://www.hackthebox.eu/ | base64`
- Decoding in shell
	- `echo aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGFja3RoZWJveC5ldS8K | base64 -d`

##### Hex
- spotting
	- only encoded in hex value. 0-9 a-f
- encoding in terminal
	- `echo https://www.hackthebox.eu/ | xxd -p`
- Decoding
	- `echo 68747470733a2f2f7777772e6861636b746865626f782e65752f0a | xxd -p -r`

Rot13 - Cesar Cypher
- spotting
	- can be easy to spot from the way the string looks `uggcf://jjj.unpxgurobk.rh/` still looks like a url
- Encoding and decoding
	- `echo https://www.hackthebox.eu/ | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`
