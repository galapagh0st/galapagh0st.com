## Sql Injection

### UNION Statement
 Union can only operate on select statements with an equal number of columns being returned.

because of this we might want to sometimes add artificial columns to the statement to make the query even out.

NULL Fits all data types

## Union Injection

First Order:
Step 1 - Check if it is able to be injected

Step 2 - See how many columns the query sends back
	- With `ORDER BY`
		- Go in sequential order until you get an error back
			- `ORDER BY 1`, etc
	- With `UNION`
		- Go in sequential order but with `UNION`
			- `UNION select 1,2,3`


Step 3 - Find the location of the injection
- Its valuable to use numbers as junk data since it will give us information in regards to which tables are being used. For example if we test with `UNION select 1,2,3,4` maybe we would only see 2,3, and 4. 
	- In a case like this we will know that our grab for information can be placed in the second result. Say if we want to get the version of DB
	- `UNION select 1,@@version,3,4`
