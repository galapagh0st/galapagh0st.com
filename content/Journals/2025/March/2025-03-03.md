Watching videos on Hackinghub in the resources section

## How to Pick a Target
-- Recommend VDP for first time - These are unpaid and is a good place to start. The reason is because of low competition so it is easier to hack on.
	- IBM is a good one
	- This helps with building methodology
	- Look at top three BB places and do VDP's

-- Pick newer since it might have more vulns
	- response time
	- payrate

## CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
- CVSS Calculator
	- You use this to set the severity of your bounty
	- Since its subjective you might go back and forth so use CVSS as part of your argument
	- AV:N you use this for web application bug bounties
- Bug Crowds Vuln Rating
	- stuff

This day was kinda lack luster in the learning department. None of this seemed like stuff to take notes on and will probably have to revisit once I get to actually doing VDP's
