## Learning 

### Recon on Hackinghub
- Look into google dorking
- Certificate transparency - crt.sh
```bash
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?cn\=%.$1\&output=json | jq -r '.[].name_value' | sed 's/\*\.//g' | sort -u

```
This script should be saved as a bash command that would work like crtsh paypal.com and get a list of domains tied to cert. once piped to a .txt we can use the following to grab all the domains

```bash
cat file.txt | rev | cut -d *.* -f 1,2 | rev | sort -u > newfile.txt
```

- Subfinder is a tool you can use to find Subdomains
